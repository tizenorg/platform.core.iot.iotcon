[A] DISCOVER DEVICES ON NETWORK

 - First of all, you can find your devices using this menu. Owned devices are already
 registered by provisioning tools, and unowned devices are not registered yet. If you find
 unowned devices, you can register the devices using [B].

[B] REGISTER/OWN ALL DISCOVERED UNOWNED DEVICES

 - After you find your unowned devices, you can register the devices using this menu.
 After you complete this procedure, you can check the result by calling [A] one more.

[C] PROVISION/LINK PAIRWISE THINGS

 - In this menu, there are two kinds of functions. One of them is "provision credentials".
 credential is information for secure communication. i.e., if you want to communicate
 securely between two devices, you should provision credentials to related devices.
 Other one is "provision ACL". ACL is information for access control. Provisioning ACL,
 you can control access for resources.

[D] UNLINK PAIRWISE THINGS

 - If you use this menu, you can unlink pairwise things. Because credentials between devices
 is removed, it is impossible to communicate securely between the devices.

[E] REMOVE THE SELECTED DEVICE

 - If you don't use a device, you can remove the device using this menu. After it is operated,
 credentials related to the device is removed from all devices in subnet.
